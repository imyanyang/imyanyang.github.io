## Will this match end the debate of who is the GOAT of this generation? and Some Thoughts about Soccer

Well, I never thought I would follow the sport this far since I never played soccer on the pitch and I became a fan quite late in my life. It was in the summer of 2014, when I graduated from Shandong. I was depressed and confused about my life at that time because it seemed I did not head to where I want to be. I stayed at home hanging out with families and friends, sleeping, and watching TV for the summer vacation before graduate school. Quite accidentally, I came across a highlight of a soccer match on the sports channel when I was boredly switching channels. It was Argentina vs. Iran, a world cup group stage match. It was a really competitive one even if you only saw the highlight of the match. Iran had a few great chances to score, so did Argentina. Lionel Messi scored almost a last-minute goal during stoppage time at the second half. The way he scored that goal, outside the box, with his left foot, his celebration, fans' cheering, the atmosphere, and the passion, everything. That was exciting! I began to follow and watch soccer since then. Unfortunately, Argentina lost the final against Germany. I watched that game live at 3 AM in a shared space for students who were doing summer jobs in Chongqing. I still remembered how happy one of my friends was when Gotze scored that pivotal goal in extra time. I was sad for almost one week. They were so close to the cup but missed it, sort of echoing what I had missed in my life at that time. I did not realize that "win or lose, it's part of life". Nor did I enjoy that match because I focused too much on the result. I thought nobody would care about your effort if you lost in the end. Even if you lost as the second-best team, it was still a complete failure.  

More than eight years have gone by since 2014’s final.  Tomorrow, another final for Argentina.  I feel it is a perfect time for me to look back, reflecting on my experience as a soccer fan.  Damn, how should I begin? Too many moments come across my mind.  From La Liga to Premier League, from EI Clasico to Manchester Derby, to London Derby, from Champions League to Euro, to Copa America, from my first British supervisor, who is a Man U supporter to my primary school classmate, who is a die-hard fan for Real Madrid, to a professor in my department supporting Bayern Munich (We had some great banter in group meeting.), and my numerous friends who are passionate about the sport. I have gradually come to appreciate the beauty of the match and the sports spirit inherent in it.  
In essence, soccer is about how do players utilize the time, the space, and the ball most efficiently, and of course, to score goals.  Since I do not actually play soccer, it took me a while to understand the laws of the game (see The FA Handbook for detail. I know it’s nerdy, but this is what I did.), especially some tricky situations in which I thought the referee should not or should do this or that (We still have many complaints about the referees depending on different style of different referees after each match, and recently, complaints about the VAR…). I admit I could not fully understand the match, but it is not an obstacle for me, otherwise I would be a professional. I enjoy discussing, arguing, joking with my friends about the match, the players, the managers, and the crazy fans, etc.  At the beginning, I was quite feisty when encountered fans from rivalry teams. I would not speak to my classmates if they supported the rivalry teams at that time. We even gave each other bad nick names such as dogs or pigs. It was funny and it is natural as many sports fans are aggressive, corky, and even ruthless.  Not until I began to follow EPL did I understand that different teams have different styles, different players have different traits, and different managers have different philosophies. As long as you make full use of your advantage to win the game, no tactics are inferior to another (Personal preference also plays a large part in this.). A typical example is how Jose Mourinho became famous with his defensive “parking the bus” tactics and played counterattack with underdog teams.  Maybe I mellowed out as I become older. I even have some close friends supporting rivalry teams as I mentioned earlier.  I wish your team lose and my team win. At the end of the match, it is what it is, and we appreciate great performance from both sides.
