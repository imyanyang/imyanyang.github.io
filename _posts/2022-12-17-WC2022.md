## Will this match end the debate of who is the GOAT of this generation? and Some Thoughts about Soccer

Well, I never thought I would follow the sport this far since I never played soccer on the pitch and I became a fan quite late in my life. It was in the summer of 2014, when I graduated from Shandong. I was depressed and confused about my life at that time because it seems I did not head to where I want to be. I stayed at home hanging out with families and friends, sleeping, and watching TV for the summer vacation before graduate school. Quite accidently, I came across a highlight of a soccer match on the sports channel when I was boredly switching channels. It was Argentina vs. Iran, a world cup group stage match. It was a really competitive one even if you only saw the highlight of the match. Iran had a few great chances to score, so did Argentina. Lionel Messi scored almost a last-minute goal during stoppage time at the second half. The way he scored that goal, outside the box, with his left foot, his celebration, fans' cheering, the atmosphere, and the passion, everything. That was exciting! I began to follow and watch soccer since then. Unfortunately, Argentina lost the final against Germany. I watched that game live at 3 AM in a shared space for students who were doing summer jobs in Chongqing. I still remembered how happy one of my friends was when Gotze scored that pivotal goal in extra time. I was sad for almost one week. They were so close to the cup but missed it, sort of echoing what I had missed in my life at that time. I did not realize that "win or lose, it's part of life".
