  <h3 id="section">Will this match end the debate about who is the best player of this generation? and some thoughts about soccer</h3>
<p>
  Well, I never thought I would follow the sport this far since I never played soccer on the pitch,
  and I became a fan quite late in my life. It was in the summer of 2014 when I graduated from Shandong.
  I was confused about my life at that time because it seemed I did not get to where I wanted to be.
  I stayed at home, hanging out with families and friends, sleeping, and watching TV for the summer
  vacation before graduate school. Quite accidentally, I came across a highlight of a soccer match
  when I was boredly switching channels. It was Argentina vs. Iran, a World Cup group stage match.
  It was a really competitive one, even if you only saw the highlights. Iran had a few great chances
  to score, as did Argentina. Lionel Messi scored almost a last-minute goal during stoppage time in the second half.
  The way he scored that goal: outside the box, with his left foot, the neat execution, his celebration,
  the fans' cheering, the atmosphere, and the passion—everything. That was exciting!
  I began to follow and watch soccer since then. Unfortunately, Argentina lost the final against Germany.
  I watched that game live at 3 a.m. in a shared space for students who were doing summer jobs.
  I still remember how happy one of my friends was when Gotze scored that pivotal goal in extra time.
  I was sad for almost a week. They were so close to the cup but lost it, sort of echoing what I had missed in my life.
  I did not realize that “win or lose, it’s part of life”. Nor did I enjoy that match because I focused too much on the result.
  I thought nobody would care about your effort if you lost in the end. Even if you lost as the second-best team,
  it was still a complete failure.
</p>

<p>
  More than eight years have gone by since 2014's World Cup final. Another final for Argentina tomorrow.
  I feel that it is a perfect time for me to look back and reflect on my experience as a soccer fan. Damn,
  how should I begin? Too many moments come to mind. From La Liga to Premier League, from EI Clasico to
  Manchester Derby, to London Derby, from Champions League to Euro, to Copa America, from my first British
  supervisor, who is a Man U supporter, to my primary school classmate, who is a die-hard fan for Real Madrid,
  to a professor in my department supporting Bayern Munich (we had some banter in our group meeting), and to my
  numerous friends who are passionate about the sport. I have gradually come to appreciate the beauty of the
  match and the sports spirit inherent in it.
</p>

<p>
  In essence, soccer is about how players utilize time, space, and the ball most efficiently, and of course,
  to score goals. Since I do not actually play soccer, it took me a while to understand the laws of the game,
  especially some tricky situations in which I thought the referee should not or should do this or that
  (we still have many complaints or arguments about the referees depending on the different styles of
  different referees after each match, and recently, complaints about the VAR). I enjoy discussing, arguing,
  and joking with my friends about the match, the players, the managers, the crazy fans, etc. At the beginning,
  I was quite feisty when I encountered fans from rival teams. I would not speak to my classmates if
  they supported the rivalry teams. We even gave each other bad nicknames, such as the XX team's dogs or
  pigs. It was funny, and it is natural, as many sports fans are aggressive, corky, and even ruthless. Not until
  I began to follow the EPL did I understand that different teams have different styles, different players have
  different traits, and different managers have different philosophies. As long as you make full use of your
  advantage to win the game, no tactic is inferior to another (personal preference also plays a large part in
  this). A typical example is how Jose Mourinho made his name with his defensive “parking the bus” tactics and
  played counterattacks with underdog teams. Maybe I mellowed out as I got older. I even have some close friends
  who support rival teams. I wish your team lost and my team won. At the end of the day, it is what it is. And we
  appreciate great performances from both sides.
</p>

<p>
  About the beauty of the match, I think there are two completely different aesthetics in general. One focuses on
  physicality, while the other emphasizes skills. Although one could argue both components are indispensable for
  great team performance, certain teams do vary in terms of their level of physicality and skills. This leads to a
  long-standing debate about who is the best player of this era. CR7 or LM10? Will this final crown LM10 over CR7
  as the best player if the former wins the World Cup? My answer is no. People who appreciate skills more would still
  think Messi is the best, and vice versa. This is just a reflection of different preferences and tastes. I have my
  personal preference, but it will not restrict me from appreciating achieving the same result through a different
  energy vibe.
</p>

<p>
  I benefit from following soccer mainly through what I learn from the people involved in the match, especially
  from players and managers. How do they stay calm under tremendous pressure? How do they behave at the 12-yard
  spot? How do they show their dedication and become MOTM? How do they carry that big-man energy and take
  responsibility? How do they hold on to their dreams in difficult situations? How do they respond to suspicion?
  How do they deal with failure? How do they argue and fight back? And even how do they handle questions in press
  conferences? How do they treasure teammates, families, friends, and fans? … They taught me “nothing is impossible"
  and “never give up.”. It is fascinating to watch the lowest-ranked team beat the top-ranked team. Let alone the
  madness of a historical comeback or the bitterness of losing a match due to a small mistake. This is why we have
  dreams, why we work hard, and why we always want new challenges and try to break limits. Sometimes you could be terribly
  fouled or injured and miss a few important matches. Then you learn how to play smart and protect yourself against
  opponents. Sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose. No team can win all the matches at once. You must learn how
  to let go and try to improve whenever you can. Aside from the above, I also enjoy discussion about tactics, healthy
  banter, and hilarious memes alongside each match.
</p>

<p>
  Thanks to soccer, I have enjoyed these eight years. I wonder if there really are aliens in distant space.
  Will they laugh at these 22 people fighting for a cup every four years?
</p>

<p>
  Good luck to both sides tomorrow!
