Welcome to Yan's Blog! 
I write down answers to questions frequently asked by students to help you comprehend seemingly complex ideas in Corporate Finance.

## About the Fisher Separation Theorem

The main idea of the theorem is as follows: when making an investment decision, an investor will separate personal consumption preferences from this investment decision. What matters is the net present value of an investment opportunity. In other words, the value of an investment to an individual depends on the comparative value of the investment over a relevant alternative in the financial market, rather than personal consumption preferences. 

Similarly, investment decisions made by the corporations will not be affected by corporate strategies, culture, or management preferences, etc. All shareholders will be better off if managers accept a project with positive net present value, vice versa.

Keep in mind with the following two assumptions for the Separation Theorem to hold:

- No frictions in the financial market, meaning no cost associated with adjusting consumption over time
- Rationality, meaning investors and firms are engaging in maximizing utility, here, financial resources
