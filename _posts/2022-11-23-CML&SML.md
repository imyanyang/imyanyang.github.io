## Capital Market Line (CML) vs. Security Market Line (SML)

Many students have difficulties in understanding intuition behind and differences between CML and SML. The following summary might help you.

The starting point of the discussion is how to allocate assets to construct an optimal portfolio that fits a rational investor's risk preference. Let us refer a 
typical rational investor as "she" thereafter. 

We start by a combination of risk-free assets and risky assets. Why does she need to consider investing in risk-free assets in constructing an optimal portfolio? Shouldn't she focus on risky assets given that her goal is to maximize return and risky assets give her higher return than risk-free assets? The answer is intuitive. 
Higher return comes with a price: higher risk. What she would want to achive is the best risk-return tradeoff. As you can see in the CML graph below, if she invests 100% of her assets in risk-free assets, the expected return of the portfolio is the risk-free rate Rf, and the expected risk of the portfolio is 0. (Point A on the graph.) As she adds more risky assets into her portfolio, the expected return of the portfolio is becoming higher than Rf (You could imagine drawing a straight line starting from point A and to the upper-right of point A. In fact, you could draw many similar straight lines from point A.) , so is the expected risk of the portfolio. By combining risk-free assets and risky assets in forming a portfolio, she sets a lower bound of the expected return of the portfolio. Besides, we know that the expected return of a portfolio is the weighted average of return of each security in the portfolio and the formula of the standard deviation of a porfolio on slide 4 of lecture 14. Mathmatically, the weighted average of return on risk-free assets and risky assets will be higher than risk-free rate as long as the expected return of risky assets is higher than rick-free rate (Wa * E(Ra) + Wf * Rf > Rf if E(Ra) > Rf, where Wa + Wf = 1). More importantly, the expected risk of the portfolio is Wa*sigma of a, which is lower than sigma of a, the standard deviation of the risky assets. Therefore, by moving on the satraight line starting from point A to the upper-right, she could achive higher expected return by increasing the weight of risky assets in the portfolio while bearing higher risk (the risk is lower than only invest in risky assets.), but still secure a minimum expected return of the portfolio. 

CML is one of these straight lines starting from point A and to the upper-right of point A, and is tangent to the efficient frontier. The tangent point is point M. Given risk-free rate, and expected return (standdard deviation) of risky assets, and covariance among various risky assets, point M is the optimal portfolio of risky assets, which gives her the best risk-return tradeoff. Every rational investor would invest in the optimal risky portfolio (point M) because it has the highest Sharpe ratio (the highest ratio of the expected abnormal return over per unit of standard deviation, aka, risk.), regardless of risk tolerance, and given investors have homogeneous beliefs regarding expected returns, standdard deviation, and covariances. We also call this portfolio "Market Portfolio". Moving on CML, she changes the  optimal combinations of a risk-free assets and the market portfolio according to her risk preference. The slope of CML is the Sharpe ratio of the market portfolio.

SML depicts the expected return on individual security. It is a key result of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The slope of SML is the market risk premium (E(Rm)-Rf). Beta measures systematic risk of individual security.

- CML traces the expected return on a portfolio whereas SML focuses on the expected return of individual security. 
- CML gives us the efficient set of holdings formed with both risky assets and the risk-free asset. It measures risk using standard deviation. Practioners often use CML to derive the expected return that investors expect given a certain amount of risk in the portfolio.
- SML shows that higher beta stocks must be compensated with higher return, and beta is a measure of undiversifiable risk (systematic risk).  It measures risk using beta. Practioners use it to estimate the cost of equity.
