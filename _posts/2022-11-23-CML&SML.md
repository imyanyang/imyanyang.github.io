## Capital Market Line (CML) vs. Security Market Line (SML)

Many students have difficulties in understanding intuition behind and differences between CML and SML. The following summary might help you.

The starting point of the discussion is how to allocate assets to construct an optimal portfolio that fits a rational investor's risk preference. Let us refer a 
typical rational investor as "she" thereafter. 

We start by a combination of risk-free assets and risky assets. Why does she need to consider investing in risk-free assets in constructing an optimal portfolio? Shouldn't she focus on risky assets given that her goal is to maximize return and risky assets give her higher return than risk-free assets? The answer is intuitive. 
Higher return comes with a price: higher risk. What she would want to achive is the best risk-return tradeoff. As you can see in the CML graph below, if she invests 100% of her assets in risk-free assets, the expected return of the portfolio is the risk-free rate $R_f$, and the expected risk of the portfolio is 0. (Point A on the graph.) As she adds more risky assets into her portfolio, the expected return of the portfolio is becoming higher than $R_f$ (You could imagine drawing a straight line starting from point A and to the up-right of point A. In fact, you can draw many similar straight lines from point A.) , so is the expected risk of the portfolio. By combining risk-free assets and risky assets in forming a portfolio, she sets a lower bound

The slope of CML is the Sharpe Ratio of the Tangency Portfolio.
