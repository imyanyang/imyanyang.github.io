## How to understand the alternative definitions of Operating Cash Flow (OCF)?

In corporate finance, cash flow data is perhaps the most important piece of information contained in financial statements. OCF is the net cash inflow generated by the regualr 
operating activities of a company in a given time interval. 

Different definitions of OCF measure the same thing. 

- A. Top-Down Approach

OCF = Sales - Costs - Taxes

- B. Tax Shield Approach

OCF = (Sales - Costs) * (1- Tc) + Depreciation * Tc

- C. Bottom-Up Approach

OCF = Net income + Depreciation
