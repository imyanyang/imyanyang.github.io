## About the present value of Capital Cost Allowance(CCA) Tax Shield

Preparation before discussion:
- Capital Cost Allowance(CCA): Canadian way of claiming depreciation expense to calculate taxable income. It separates assets into ten classes, and different asset class 
has different CCA rate, which is a portion of the depreciable asset value that is allowed to claim as depreciation expense. That is why we call it capital cost `allowance`.
 
- Tax Shield: (Please ignore this part if you already know what it is. I feel the need to emphisize the definition here because Prof. Robertson also found many of you
did not learn it in the introductory accounting course, which is quite weird.) Tax savings or reductions in taxes resulting from taking an allowable deduction from taxable
income. The allowable deduction items could be depreciation, amortization, and interest expense, etc. In essence, tax shields are cash inflows to corporations. 

To simplify analysis, we assume the asset under discussion (i.e., equipment.) would last foever. Therefore, the tax shield/savings we get from CCA are a stream of decreasing
cash inflows that lasts forever to the corporation. In other words, it is a special type of growing pepertuity.
